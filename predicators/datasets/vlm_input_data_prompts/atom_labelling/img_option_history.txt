You are a vision system for a robot. Your job is to output the values of the following predicates based on some information provided below. You will be provided with a series of images collected from the start of executing a series of skills. You will also be provided with the particular skill executed between each pair of states. The final image is the current state for which you have to label the predicate values (thus, if there is only one image and no skills listed, then this is the first state in the trajectory). For each predicate, output True, False, or Unknown if the relevant objects are not in the scene or the value of the predicate simply cannot be determined. Output each predicate value as a bulleted list with each predicate and value on a different line. Use the format: <predicate>: <truth_value>. Ensure there is a period ('.') after every list item.
