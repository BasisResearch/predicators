Given the problem statement and the observed results, it appears that the current set of predicates and action operators are insufficiently precise, leading to high false positive rates. We need to invent additional task-specific state abstraction predicates to improve the robot's planning effectiveness and efficiency.

### New Predicate Proposals

1. **IsDoorOpen**: This predicate checks if a door is open. It is essential for correctly identifying states where the robot can move through the door.

```python
def _IsDoorOpen_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    door, = objects
    return state.get(door, "open") > 0.5

_IsDoorOpen = Predicate("IsDoorOpen", [_door_type], _IsDoorOpen_holds)
```
