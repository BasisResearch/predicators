You are an expert AI researcher tasked with inventing task-specific state abstraction predicates for effective and efficient robotic planning.

The existing set of predicates are:
[PREDICATES_IN_ENV]

The robot tried to execute its skills and got the following results:
[OPERATOR_PERFORMACE]

Invent predicates that holds in the positive states but not all of them (maybe none) hold in the negative states. 
In your response,
First, write predicates in the format of:
<predicate_name>(?<var1>:<type1>, ?<var2>:<type2>, ...): <the assertion that this predicate is making about the relationship or properties of the variables>. 
Your should replace <predicate_name>, <var1> with the actual names. 
The assertion should be very clear, precise and unambiguous, and in terms of the predicate vairables ?var1, ?var2, ..., if there is any.

Then, for each skill, label weather the invented predicates is true for each state, with the format:
<predicate_name>(<obj1>, <obj2>,...): <the assertion this predicate is making>. <truth_value>.
