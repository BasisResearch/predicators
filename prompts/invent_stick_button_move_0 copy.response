Based on the provided data, I will define the necessary predicates to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning operators. These predicates will help in filtering out false positive states and ensuring true positive states meet the preconditions.

### Predicate 1: HandIsOpen
This predicate checks if the robot's hand is open (fingers > 0.5).
```python
def _HandIsOpen_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, = objects
    return state.get(hand, "fingers") > 0.5

_HandIsOpen = Predicate("HandIsOpen", [_hand_type], _HandIsOpen_holds)
```

### Predicate 2: StickIsHeld
This predicate checks if the stick is held by the robot's hand (held > 0.5).
```python
def _StickIsHeld_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, = objects
    return state.get(stick, "held") > 0.5

_StickIsHeld = Predicate("StickIsHeld", [_stick_type], _StickIsHeld_holds)
```

### Predicate 3: HandAtButton
This predicate checks if the robot's hand is at the button's location (x and y coordinates match within a tolerance).
```python
def _HandAtButton_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, button = objects
    hand_x, hand_y = state.get(hand, "x"), state.get(hand, "y")
    button_x, button_y = state.get(button, "x"), state.get(button, "y")
    tolerance = 0.1
    return abs(hand_x - button_x) <= tolerance and abs(hand_y - button_y) <= tolerance

_HandAtButton = Predicate("HandAtButton", [_hand_type, _button_type], _HandAtButton_holds)
```

### Predicate 4: StickAtButton
This predicate checks if the stick's tip is at the button's location (tip_x and tip_y coordinates match within a tolerance).
```python
def _StickAtButton_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, button = objects
    stick_tip_x, stick_tip_y = state.get(stick, "tip_x"), state.get(stick, "tip_y")
    button_x, button_y = state.get(button, "x"), state.get(button, "y")
    tolerance = 0.1
    return abs(stick_tip_x - button_x) <= tolerance and abs(stick_tip_y - button_y) <= tolerance

_StickAtButton = Predicate("StickAtButton", [_stick_type, _button_type], _StickAtButton_holds)
```

### Predicate 5: HandAtHolder
This predicate checks if the robot's hand is at the holder's location (x and y coordinates match within a tolerance).
```python
def _HandAtHolder_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, holder = objects
    hand_x, hand_y = state.get(hand, "x"), state.get(hand, "y")
    holder_x, holder_y = state.get(holder, "x"), state.get(holder, "y")
    tolerance = 0.1
    return abs(hand_x - holder_x) <= tolerance and abs(hand_y - holder_y) <= tolerance

_HandAtHolder = Predicate("HandAtHolder", [_hand_type, _holder_type], _HandAtHolder_holds)
```

### Predicate 6: HandIsClosed
This predicate checks if the robot's hand is closed (fingers < 0.5).
```python
def _HandIsClosed_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, = objects
    return state.get(hand, "fingers") < 0.5

_HandIsClosed = Predicate("HandIsClosed", [_hand_type], _HandIsClosed_holds)
```

### Predicate 7: StickInHolder
This predicate checks if the stick is placed in the holder's location (x and y coordinates match within a tolerance).
```python
def _StickInHolder_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, holder = objects
    stick_x, stick_y = state.get(stick, "x"), state.get(stick, "y")
    holder_x, holder_y = state.get(holder, "x"), state.get(holder, "y")
    tolerance = 0.1
    return abs(stick_x - holder_x) <= tolerance and abs(stick_y - holder_y) <= tolerance

_StickInHolder = Predicate("StickInHolder", [_stick_type, _holder_type], _StickInHolder_holds)
```

These predicates can now be integrated into the action operators' preconditions and effects to enhance planning accuracy. They will ensure the robot only considers valid states when planning actions, thereby improving the success rates of the executed actions.
