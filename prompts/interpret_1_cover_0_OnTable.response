To answer the query "Does the block currently lie on the table?" using the ImagePatch class, you would design a function that checks if the specified block is located on what can be identified as the "table" within the image. The function will utilize the `exists` method to verify the presence of the block and the table, and spatial comparison to ascertain if the block is on the table. Spatial relations can be derived from the positions of the block and the table within the image, assuming a simplified scenario where vertical alignment and relative position can indicate one object being on top of another.

Here's a basic approach to implement the function:

```python
from typing import List

def is_block_on_table(environment_patch: ImagePatch, block_patch: ImagePatch) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether the block currently lies on the table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch object representing the entire environment observation.
    block_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch object representing the block in question.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the block lies on the table, False otherwise.
    """
    # Find all 'table' objects in the environment
    table_patches = environment_patch.find("table")
    
    # If there's no table in the environment, return False
    if not table_patches:
        return False

    # Iterate through all found tables to check if any block is on them
    for table_patch in table_patches:
        # Check if the block's lower edge is just above the table's upper edge,
        # indicating it's lying on the table. This is a simplified approach and
        # might need adjustments based on the actual coordinate system and perspective.
        if block_patch.lower >= table_patch.upper and block_patch.overlaps_with(
                table_patch.left, table_patch.lower, table_patch.right, table_patch.upper):
            return True
    
    # If none of the tables have the block on them, return False
    return False
```

This function first finds all instances of "table" within the given environment observation (`environment_patch`). For each table detected, it checks if the block (`block_patch`) is positioned above it, considering a simple geometrical relationship based on the coordinates of the block and the table. The block is considered to be on the table if its lower edge is just above the table's upper edge and horizontally overlaps with the table. 

This approach assumes a simplified model where objects are primarily differentiated and related through vertical positioning and horizontal overlap within the image. Depending on the complexity of the images and the specifics of the coordinate system, further refinements might be needed for accurate determination.
