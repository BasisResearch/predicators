```python
def _BlockGrasped_holds(state: RawState, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    '''
    Determine if the block is grasped by the robot.
    '''
    block, = objects
    robot, = state.get_objects(_robot_type)
    
    if state.get(robot, "fingers") > 0.5:
        return False
    # return state.get(block, "grasp") != -1
    
    block_name = block.id_name
    robot_name = robot.id_name
    attention_image = state.crop_to_objects([block, robot])
    return state.evaluate_simple_assertion(
        f"{block_name} is grasped by {robot_name}", attention_image)

# Define the predicate name here 
name: str = "BlockGrasped"

# A list of object-type variables for the predicate, using the ones defined in the environment
param_types: Sequence[Type] = [_block_type] 
BlockGrasped = NSPredicate(name, param_types, _BlockGrasped_holds)
```

This predicate uses the `evaluate_simple_assertion` to determine if the robot is actually grasping the block. This could be helpful to ensure the "Pick" action was successful before attempting a "Place" action.

**Remember:** These are just examples, and the most effective predicates will depend on the specific details of your environment and task. You may need to experiment with different features and thresholds to find the predicates that best capture the relevant state information.
