def is_robot_holding_block(environment_patch: ImagePatch, robot_patch: ImagePatch, block_patch: ImagePatch) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if the robot is holding a particular block based on their positions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment_patch : ImagePatch
        The entire scene as an ImagePatch.
    robot_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch corresponding to the robot.
    block_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch corresponding to the block.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the robot is holding the block, False otherwise.

    # Assumption: The robot's "hand" is considered to be in the lower part of its image patch.
    # The 'holding' condition requires the robot's lower part to be vertically aligned with the block's upper part,
    # and they need to be horizontally aligned or close enough to suggest the robot could be holding the block.

# The actual patches (robot_patch, block_patch) would be obtained from the environment_patch using the find method.
