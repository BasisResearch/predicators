To answer the query "Is the block at the target position?" using the ImagePatch class and the guidelines provided, we can create a function that leverages the `overlaps_with` method of the ImagePatch class. This method will be crucial to determine if the `block` ImagePatch overlaps with the `target` ImagePatch, which would imply that the block is at the target position.

Here's how you could implement this function:

```python
def is_block_at_target(block_patch: ImagePatch, target_patch: ImagePatch) -> str:
    """
    Determines whether a given block is at the target position by checking if the block's image patch
    overlaps with the target's image patch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    block_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch object representing the block.
    target_patch : ImagePatch
        The ImagePatch object representing the target.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A string "yes" if the block is at the target position (i.e., the patches overlap), otherwise "no".
    """
    # Check if the block overlaps with the target
    if block_patch.overlaps_with(target_patch.left, target_patch.lower, target_patch.right, target_patch.upper):
        return "yes"
    else:
        return "no"

# Example usage:
# Assuming block_patch and target_patch are predefined ImagePatch objects representing the block and the target respectively
# result = is_block_at_target(block_patch, target_patch)
# print(result)
```

This function checks if the `block_patch` overlaps with the `target_patch` by directly using their geometric properties, specifically the corners of their bounding boxes. The `overlaps_with` method is used to determine if there's any overlap between the two patches. If there is an overlap, it is assumed the block is at the target position, and the function returns `"yes"`. Otherwise, it returns `"no"`.
