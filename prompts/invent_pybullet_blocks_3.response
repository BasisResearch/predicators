You are absolutely right! There are a few other predicates that would be very helpful for this robotic planning problem. Here are some ideas:

**1. `Clear(?x:block)`**

* **Purpose:** This predicate checks if a block has a clear top surface, meaning no other blocks are on top of it.
* **Implementation:**
```python
def _Clear_holds(state: RawState, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    '''
    Determine if there are no blocks on top of the input block. 
    '''
    block, = objects
    block_name = block.id_name
    # Iterate over all other blocks
    for other_block in state.get_objects(_block_type):
        other_block_name = other_block.id_name
        if other_block_name == block_name:
            continue
        # If any block is on top of the target block, it's not clear
        if _On_NSP_holds(state, [other_block, block]):
            return False 
    return True

_Clear = NSPredicate("Clear", [_block_type], _Clear_holds) 
```

**2. `Near(?x:block, ?y:block)`**

* **Purpose:** Determines if two blocks are spatially close to each other, which could be helpful for picking and placing actions. You can define "near" using a distance threshold on their bounding box coordinates.
* **Implementation:**
```python
def _Near_holds(state: RawState, objects: Sequence[Object], distance_threshold: int = 20) -> bool:
    '''
    Determine if two blocks are near each other based on a distance 
    threshold of their bounding boxes.
    '''
    block1, block2 = objects
    block1_name, block2_name = block1.id_name, block2.id_name
    
    # If they are the same block, they are not considered near each other.
    if block1_name == block2_name:
        return False

    # Calculate the distance between the centers of their bounding boxes.
    center_x1 = (state.get(block1, "bbox_left") + state.get(block1, "bbox_right")) / 2
    center_y1 = (state.get(block1, "bbox_lower") + state.get(block1, "bbox_upper")) / 2
    center_x2 = (state.get(block2, "bbox_left") + state.get(block2, "bbox_right")) / 2
    center_y2 = (state.get(block2, "bbox_lower") + state.get(block2, "bbox_upper")) / 2
    distance = ((center_x1 - center_x2)**2 + (center_y1 - center_y2)**2)**0.5

    return distance <= distance_threshold 

_Near = NSPredicate("Near", [_block_type, _block_type], _Near_holds) 
```

**How these predicates improve planning:**

* **More Specific Preconditions:** Predicates like `Clear` and `GripperOpen` allow you to create much more precise preconditions for your actions. For example, `Stack` would require `Clear(?otherblock)` and `GripperClosed(?robot)`. 
* **Fewer Unnecessary Actions:**  The robot won't try to stack a block on a non-clear block or pick up a block with an already open gripper. 
* **More Efficient Plans:** With more specific preconditions, the planner can eliminate many impossible action sequences, leading to faster plan generation. 

**Note:** These predicates use a combination of simple rules and visual reasoning (`evaluate_simple_assertion`). You can adjust the complexity of these predicates based on the capabilities of your VLM and the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
