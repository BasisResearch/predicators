To improve the planning effectiveness and efficiency in the given robotic environment, I will define new predicates that ensure the ground option executions align with the state conditions, focusing on ensuring the action operators are only applicable in states where they are feasible, thus reducing false positives and enhancing true positives.

Here are a few examples of predicates I propose:

### 1. `IsHeld`
This predicate checks if the stick is currently held by the robot's hand, which is crucial for operations that involve moving or utilizing the stick.

```python
def _IsHeld_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, = objects
    return state.get(stick, "held") > 0.5

name: str = "IsHeld"
types: Sequence[Type] = [_stick_type]
IsHeld = Predicate(name, types, _IsHeld_holds)
```

### 2. `IsFree`
This predicate determines if the stick is not held by any entity (the robot or otherwise), useful for picking up the stick.

```python
def _IsFree_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, = objects
    return state.get(stick, "held") < 0.5

name: str = "IsFree"
types: Sequence[Type] = [_stick_type]
IsFree = Predicate(name, types, _IsFree_holds)
```

### 3. `ButtonNotPressed`
Ensures the button is not currently pressed. This is crucial for actions intended to press a button to change its state to pressed.

```python
def _ButtonNotPressed_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    button, = objects
    return state.get(button, "pressed") < 0.5

name: str = "ButtonNotPressed"
types: Sequence[Type] = [_button_type]
ButtonNotPressed = Predicate(name, types, _ButtonNotPressed_holds)
```

### 4. `CorrectPositionForPressing`
Checks if the hand or the stick (if used) is in a correct position to press a specific button effectively.

```python
def _CorrectPositionForPressing_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, button = objects
    hand_x = state.get(hand, "x")
    hand_y = state.get(hand, "y")
    button_x = state.get(button, "x")
    button_y = state.get(button, "y")
    return abs(hand_x - button_x) < 0.1 and abs(hand_y - button_y) < 0.1

name: str = "CorrectPositionForPressing"
types: Sequence[Type] = [_hand_type, _button_type]
CorrectPositionForPressing = Predicate(name, types, _CorrectPositionForPressing_holds)
```

### 5. `StickAlignedWithButton`
Verifies that the stick, if held, aligns with the button to press it. This would be particularly relevant for the StickPressButton option.

```python
def _StickAlignedWithButton_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    stick, button = objects
    stick_x = state.get(stick, "x")
    stick_y = state.get(stick, "y")
    button_x = state.get(button, "x")
    button_y = state.get(button, "y")
    return abs(stick_x - button_x) < 0.1 and abs(stick_y - button_y) < 0.1

name: str = "StickAlignedWithButton"
types: Sequence[Type] = [_stick_type, _button_type]
StickAlignedWithButton = Predicate(name, types, _StickAlignedWithButton_holds)
```

These predicates, when integrated into the planning system, will refine the conditions under which actions are considered valid, aiming to enhance the overall planning efficacy by closely tying actions to the state features that determine their success.
