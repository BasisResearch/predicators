[OBJECT_CLASS_DEFINITION]

The object types in the domain are:
[TYPES_IN_ENV]

The existing predicates are:

The existing abstract action operators with options are:
[NSRTS_IN_ENV]

The agents controls a robotic arm on a stationary base.
The agents has attempted the following tasks and got the following results:

[INTERACTION_RESULTS]

Your task: define new predicates in the format of
```
predicate_name = Predicate(name: str, types: Sequence[Type], _classifier: Callable[[State, Sequence[Object]], bool])
```
to make the planning more effective and efficient (e.g., stops fast when the goals are not achievable).
Note that new action operators (NSRTs, with preconditions and effects) and options can be learned from predicates, and make sure the invented predicates they don't require extra constants.
