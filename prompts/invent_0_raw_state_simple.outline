When writing the proposals, *strictly* adhere to the following guidelines:
- When defining classifier functions, try to 
    1. *first* use rules based on object features to identify scenarios where the predicate is *clearly* False (the robot can't be holding anything if its hand is open). 
    2. Then, if necessary, use the `evaluate_simple_assertion` method *once* to cover the potential remaining cases. 
Take the format of existing predicates for reference.
- Each proposed predicate is semantically from the existing predicates and each other.
- Don't write out the new operators.
- Make use of helper functions such as the classifier function in the existing predicates and `evaluate_simple_assertion`, if they're helpful. But try not to use `evaluate_simple_assertion` in a loop.
- Don't use any undefined constants.
- Don't use object features that are not present in the definition of that object type.
- Please propose as many relevant predicates as you can.
