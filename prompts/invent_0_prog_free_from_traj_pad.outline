Context: You are an expert AI researcher tasked with inventing task-specific state abstraction predicates for effective and efficient robotic planning.

The existing predicates are:
[PREDICATES_IN_ENV]

A state (with image observations), action trajectory:
[TRAJECTORY_STR]

Objective: Propose new predicates that are important in describing the preconditions (predicates with objects that must be True) and effects of each of the actions in the trajectory. Propose at least one per action.

Instructions for Response:
1. Propose predicates in the following format:
    ```plaintext
    # Predicate Proposals
    * <predicate_name>(?<var1>:<type1>, ?<var2>:<type2>, ...): <A clear and precise assertion about the relationship or properties of the variables>.
    * ...
    ```
    * Replace `<predicate_name>`, `<var1>`, `<var2>`, etc., with actual names.
    * The assertion should be very clear, precise, and unambiguous, and in terms of the predicate variables `?<var1>`, `?<var2>`, etc., if applicable.

2. Describe the predicates that each action in the trajectory changes, in the following format:
    ```plaintext
    # Predicate Values for Before and After Each Action
    * action_<x>: <action_name_with_parameters>
        * preconditions:
            * <predicate0_name>(<obj1>, <obj2>, ...): <The assertion this predicate is making>. True.
            * ...
        * add effect:
            * <predicate3_name>(<obj5>, <obj6>, ...): <The assertion this predicate is making>.
            * ...
        * delete effect:
            * <predicate4_name>(<obj7>, <obj8>, ...): <The assertion this predicate is making>.
            * ...  
    * action_<y>: ...
    ```
    * Replace `<obj1>`, `<obj2>`, etc., with actual object names in the state.
