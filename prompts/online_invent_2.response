To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning process in the robotic arm scenario you've described, it would be beneficial to define new predicates that can capture more specific conditions relevant to the operations being performed. These predicates can help to quickly determine the feasibility of actions and provide more informed preconditions for action operators.

Here are a few suggested new predicates along with their classifiers:

1. **InReach** - Checks if an object is within the operational reach of the robotic arm based on position.
2. **IsAligned** - Verifies if the robotic hand is aligned with another object along the y-axis, useful for simplifying positioning before pressing buttons.
3. **IsAbove** - Determines if one object is directly above another along the y-axis within a threshold, helpful for precise movements or setups.

### Predicate Definitions

#### 1. `InReach` Predicate
This predicate checks if an object's position is within a predefined reachability threshold of the robotic hand. This is useful to quickly rule out actions that involve unreachable objects.

```python
def _InReach_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    hand, obj = objects
    hand_position = state.get(hand, 'x'), state.get(hand, 'y')
    obj_position = state.get(obj, 'x'), state.get(obj, 'y')
    max_reach_distance = 5.0  # Assume some reasonable maximum reach distance
    # return np.linalg.norm(np.array(hand_position) - np.array(obj_position)) <= max_reach_distance
    return 0 <= obj_position[1] <= 3.0 and 0 <= obj_position[0] <= 10

InReach = Predicate("InReach", [_hand_type, _button_type], _InReach_holds)
```
